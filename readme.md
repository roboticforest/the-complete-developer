# The Complete Developer Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and work as I read through **The Complete Developer** by Martin Krause. Each directory represents a different project that I am working on as part of the book exercises.

## Getting Started

To run any project in this repository, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository and use the following command in the project's directory to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory you want to explore and run the respective script using Node.js.

```bash
node index.js
```

Each project contains its own set of exercises and solutions based on the chapters from the book.

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!
